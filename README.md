## How to Use
You can add additional/remove cities on lines 14 - 18 (list of cities will be listed in the "Cities" section). If addtional cities are removed or added, go to line 56 and change that as well.

Additionally, you must know your BOT_TOKEN and CHANNEL_ID for your discord server and channel you want to upload (see reference [1] and [2] for finding those information).
## Automation for the Script
To run this automatically, you can use Windows Task Scheduler. Check out [3] for a video guide on how to do that.
